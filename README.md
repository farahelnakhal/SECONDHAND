# SECOND HAND

**SECOND HAND** is a web-based puzzle game centered on time manipulation, control, and consequence. It features a philosophical narrative that unfolds through a 4-act structure, where player choices determine the ultimate fate of the timeline.

## Core Mechanics

### The Authority Clock
The primary interface is the **Authority Clock**. Unlike a normal clock, this device allows you to manipulate time directly.
- **Adjust Time:** Click on Hours or Minutes to change the time.
- **Consequence:** Every manipulation creates "glitches" in the simulation. Excessive manipulation degrades the stability of the world.

### The Signal Tuner
Introduced in **Act 2**, the Signal Tuner allows you to adjust the frequency of the simulation's broadcast.
- **Frequency Control:** A slider to adjust signal strength (0-100%).
- **Puzzle Integration:** Certain anomalies and puzzles can only be resolved by tuning into specific frequencies.
- **Visual Feedback:** The signal strength directly affects the visual noise and static of the interface.

## Game Structure

The game is divided into four distinct Acts, each with its own theme and set of challenges.

### Act I: Observation
*Theme: Learning the rules.*
The player learns to observe patterns and align with the flow of time.
- **Puzzles:** Agreement, Reflection, Imbalance, Sequence, Stagnation.

### Act II: Control
*Theme: Seizing power.*
The player realizes they can bend the rules. The timeline begins to resist.
- **Puzzles:** Stillness, Precision, Outside Time, Shadow Hour, Discord.
- **Feature Unlock:** Signal Tuner.

### Act III: Resistance
*Theme: Breaking the system.*
The simulation fractures. Reality becomes unstable. Puzzles require unconventional thinking and heavy manipulation.
- **Puzzles:** Split, Inversion, Let Go, Fading, Fractured Moments.

### Act IV: Judgment
*Theme: Consequence.*
The clock disappears. The player faces the verdict of their actions.
- **The Void:** A phase of silence and darkness where the narrative judges your playstyle.
- **Final Challenge:** The clock returns for one final, ending-specific task.

## Dynamic Endings

The game tracks your behavior (manipulation count, idle time, obedience) to determine one of four unique endings:

1.  **The Custodian (Acceptance):**
    *   *Condition:* Minimal manipulation, high obedience.
    *   *Outcome:* You preserved the cycle. Time flows purely.

2.  **The Breaker (Destruction):**
    *   *Condition:* High manipulation, aggressive inputs.
    *   *Outcome:* You shattered the illusion. You are free.

3.  **The Ghost (Departure):**
    *   *Condition:* High idle time, passive observation.
    *   *Outcome:* You faded away. You were never really there.

4.  **The Architect (Alignment):**
    *   *Condition:* Balanced gameplay.
    *   *Outcome:* You rewrote the rules and built a new moment.

## Technical Features

-   **Sequential Puzzle Logic:** Puzzles appear one at a time, creating a focused narrative flow.
-   **Audio-Reactive Glitches:** Sound effects and visual distortions scale with your "Glitch Level."
-   **Atmospheric Sound Design:** Procedurally generated audio cues for ticking, solving, and horror elements.
-   **Responsive Narrative:** The story text adapts to your current Act and past actions.

## Controls

-   **Mouse:** Interact with the Clock and Signal Tuner.
-   **Keyboard:** Hidden interactions for specific secrets.
-   **Patience:** Sometimes, the only move is not to move.
