Backstory / Narrative

Time is a river, steady yet fragile. You are an apprentice of the Timekeeper, tasked with understanding its flow.
The Authority Clock is your simulator: a sandbox where seconds can be nudged, rewound, or accelerated.
Manipulate it wisely… or leave it untouched. The Timekeeper watches. Patience, curiosity, and folly all leave traces in the simulator.
Glitches are not errors—they are the echoes of your interference. Colors pulse and fracture only when time itself is disturbed.

Visual & Audio Aesthetic

Background: Black, infinite void.

Text: White, crisp sans-serif.

Clock Display: Centered, large digital clock.

Authority Clock: Corner toggle icon 🕰️; arrow keys adjust hours/minutes.

Gameplay / Instructions

Observe the clocks and solve puzzles when conditions are met.

The Authority Clock is optional; manipulate for shortcuts, secret puzzles, or meta endings.

Each puzzle can be solved honestly using real time alone.

Optional secret puzzles reward experimentation.

Endings vary based on your interaction with time.
